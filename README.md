# gyrate-simulation
A 3D boid simulation built with Three.js that models the collective motion of autonomous agents, inspired by the flocking of birds and schooling of fish. Users can adjust parameters to explore how simple rules create complex, emergent group dynamics. This project was a collaboration with the Gemini AI model.
